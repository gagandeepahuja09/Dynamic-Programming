# Dynamic-Programming
Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. 
Dynamic programming is both a mathematical optimization method and a computer programming method
Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. 
The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later.
This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial.
Here are some of the questions.
